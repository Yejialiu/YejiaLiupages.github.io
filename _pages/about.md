I'm a Senior undergraduate student from [UM-SJTU Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning and Embedded AI system.

I am very fortunate to be the incoming Mphil student of [Prof. Ouyang](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/xiaomin-ouyang) from CSE, HKUST.
